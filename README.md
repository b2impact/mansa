# Mansa - a FinOps obsessive linter

![](docs/images\meme.jpg){fig-align="center" width="397"}

FinOps is an operational framework and cultural practice that enhances the business value derived from cloud technology. It promotes data-driven decision-making in a timely manner and fosters financial responsibility. It gets achieved through collaboration among engineering, finance, and business teams.

FinOps is a discipline that combines financial management principles with cloud engineering and operations to provide organizations with a better understanding of their cloud spending. It also helps them make informed decisions on how to allocate and manage their cloud costs. The goal of FinOps isn't to save money, but to maximize revenue or business value through the cloud. It helps to enable organizations to control cloud spending while maintaining the level of performance, reliability, and security needed to support their business operations.

Mansa is a lintin tool used internally at B2-Impact to enforce cost-tagging at build time as part of our standard CI-CD pipelines for Azure Machine Learning Resources
